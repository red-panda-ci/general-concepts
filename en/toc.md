# General Concepts

Summary of general concepts related to software development.

The motivation arises from the need to document a LAMP application, developed years ago and based on Symfony, so that a company using it has a minimum of documentation about the development and can give support and continuity. At this time, they are unaware of concepts that are obvious to me, such as what an environment is, how to use Git, how Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab work, what Docker is and how it works, etc.

This documentation was born to be obselete: it deals with a web application that is now, in 2018, considered legacy since it began its development in 2011. Avoiding those particular details of the app, I'll share the rest in case it is useful to someone.

## Sections

- [Environments](environments.md) of execution
- [Repositories](repositories.md): git, GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket
- [Jenkins](jenkins.md)
- [Docker](docker.md)
- [Sonar](sonar.md)
- [Quality](qa.md)
- [Lifecycle](application-lifecycle.md)
